Welcome to the **RSA Digital Signature** project! This project implements a **digital signature** system using the **RSA cryptography algorithm**, which ensures the integrity and authenticity of digital messages. The application allows you to:

- **Generate RSA Key Pairs**: Create a public and private key pair using prime numbers.
- **Sign Messages**: Sign a message using your private key to produce a digital signature.
- **Verify Signatures**: Verify the authenticity of a signed message using the public key.

This web-based application utilizes **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for a seamless user experience, making the process of signing and verifying messages simple and intuitive.

## ðŸ’¡ Features

- **Generate RSA Keys**: Easily generate your public and private keys by inputting two prime numbers (or use random prime numbers).
- **Sign Documents**: Sign any message (or upload a file) using your private key and receive a signature.
- **Verify Signatures**: Upload a file or manually input the message and signature to verify if the signature is valid using your public key.
- **File Upload**: Support for signing and verifying text files.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For building the structure of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the user interface, making it clean and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the RSA algorithm and cryptographic functions.
  - **SHA-256 Hashing**: Used to hash messages before signing.
  - **BigInt**: For handling large numbers involved in RSA encryption and decryption.
